The solution involves understanding and carefully managing CSS specificity to ensure the intended style is applied.  The most straightforward approach would be to change the order of the style rules to make sure the rule with the highest specificity is rendered last.

Here's a corrected version: 

```css
button {
  background-color: blue;
}

.special-button {
  background-color: red;
}

#my-button {
  background-color: green;
}
```

This may not always be a reliable solution, especially in large projects with many conflicting styles. A more robust solution might involve using the `!important` flag (although generally discouraged), or restructuring the CSS to avoid the specificity conflict altogether.  Refactoring the CSS into more specific and well-organized selectors can resolve the issue permanently.
